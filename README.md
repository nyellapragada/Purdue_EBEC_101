# This repository is to create a cloud backup of my work submitted for the Purdue EBEC 101 Python Certification class. This class is uncredited and pass/fail. Upon the successful completion of this class, students receive a Certificate in Python. I am really enjoying this class as I enjoy programming when I have a cut and dry objective such as specific inputs to take and outputs to create.
